# Pull 'n Print Orders
Creates a new admin page containing only a table, one that's filled with precisely the information you need from the orders you're focusing on.

## Roadmap
1. Create new admin page
2. List it in the admin menu
3. Output a table
4. Make sure that the page is viewable only by admins, not just anyone with the URL
5. Fill the table with info wanted
    * Ship-To Name (First and Last Names)
    * Shipping Address (Street Name, City, State, Zip Code)
6. Restrict orders pulled to those between an order # range
